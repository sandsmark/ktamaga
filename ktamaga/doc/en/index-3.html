How to take care for your Tamagotchi</H3>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
First of all, Tamagotchi needs lots of attention
every 10-30 minutes or so. Don't forget to give it what it wants!</LI>

<LI>
Discipline it when it does not eat even
though it is hungry, when it does not want to play with you or when it
beeps for no reason. If you discipline it even though it is right, it will
cry and will become a very bad creature.</LI>

<LI>
If Tamagotchi falls asleep, all functions
will not be able to work except for the lights function. But remember,Tamagotchi
will wake up by itself and turn on the lights by itself. If you wake him
up, it will get sick easily and restless. When Tamagotchi is sick, even
though it is sleeping, you can give it an injection or two. When it uses
the toilet while sleeping, you cannot flush the toliet until it wakes up.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
 Don't overfeed the Tamagotchi. This will
shorten its life. Don't overfeed it with snacks. It will become fatter.
Snacks are used for making Tamagotchi happy when you don't have time to
play with it. But bear in mind that there is a limit and more snacks means
more stomachachs!</LI>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Now that you have your Tamagotchi, you must do these three things:

<P>1) Wake up Tamagotchi from its million light-year sleep by removing
the insulating sheet (pull paper tab from side of body).

<P>2) Set the tamagotchi communication screen (Reset operation). Press
the reset switch on the rear of the egg with a pointed object. <B>NOTE:</B>
Remember not to press the reset switch too hard when using a sharp rod,
pencils, sharp pens, etc.

<P>3) Adjust the time difference between Tamagotchi's planet and earth
(Timer set). First press the middle button (B) to bring up the timer screen.
Use the left button (A) to set the hours and the B button to set the minutes.
Once you have set the correct time, press the right button (C) to set the
timer. Next, return to the main screen by pressing the B button again.

<P>When you have completed these three steps, a pulsating egg will appear.
Tamagotchi will hatch in about 5 minutes.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> During this time only the timer and reset functions are
available.

<P>As soon as Tamagotchi hatches, it will beep at you for attention. This
is where the health meter comes in handy. You can determine the mood, health
and behavior of Tomagotchi with the health meter. Tamagotchi will need
to be fed and played with soon after it hatches. In order to start Tamagotchi
on a good growth path, you must take good care of Tamagotchi right from
the start.

<P><B>FEED:</B> Press A button until knife and fork icon is highlighted,
then press B. Select either Meal or Snack by pressing the B button to feed
Tamagotchi. Be careful not to over feed Tamagotchi; if you do it will refuse
to eat.

<P><B>LIGHT:</B> Press A button until the light bulb icon is highlighted,
then press the B button. Select either On or Off by pressing the A button
to move the arrow, then press the B button. The light should be turned
off when Tamagotchi is sleeping, or it might get restless! Tamagotchi will
automaticlly turn the light on when wakes up.

<P><B>DUCK:</B> Just like real pets, Tamagotchi goes to the bathroom. If
droppings appear on the screen, it must be cleaned up right away or Tamagotchi
will get sick. Press the A button until the Duck icon is highlighted, then
press the B button to flush the screen. Tamagotchi will be very happy after
the mess is cleaned up.

<P><B>HEALTH METER:</B> Check Tamagotchi's health, by pressing the A button
until the Health Meter icon is highlighted, then press B button to check
Tamagotchi's age/weight, discipline, hunger and happiness. After you have
checked all the screens to see if Tamagotchi needs anything, press C to
return to the main screen. You should also check this screen if Tamagotchi
beeps at you and the "attention" icon is highlighted.

<P><B>PLAY:</B> Press A button until the bat and ball icon is highlighted,
then press B button to begin the game. The object is to guess which way
Tamagotchi will turn. To choose left, press the A button, to choose right,
press the B button. If you choose the correct direction, Tamagotchi will
be happy. There are 5 chances in each game to match Tamagotchi; the more
you match, the happier Tamagotchi will be. To stop the game press the C
button. After playing, check the happiness meter to see if it went up or
down.

<P><B>MEDICINE:</B> If a "skull" image appears, Tamagotchi is sick and
needs medicine. Press A button until the medicine icon is highlighted,
then press B. Sometimes 2 or 3 injections are needed before Tamagotchi
is well.

<P><B>ATTENTION:</B> When this icon is highlighted, Tamagotchi needs something.
Check the Health Meter, to determine what Tamagotchi needs. If Tamagotchi
doesn't need anything, it must be disciplined or the Attention Icon will
stay highlighted.

<P><B>DISCIPLINE:</B> Tamagotchi needs discipline if it:

<P>1) beeps even though it is full and happy

<P>2) won't eat when it is hungry

<P>3) won't play games when it is not very happy. If you neglect to discipline
Tamagotchi when needed, it might grow up into an unattractive, bad mannered
alien.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>HAPPINESS AND HUNGER STATUS CHECK</B></CENTER>
<P>There are a total of 4 hearts on the "Happy" and "Hunger" screens and
they start out empty. The more hearts that are filled, the better satisfied
Tamagotchi is. You must feed or play with Tamagotchi in order to fill the
empty hearts. If you keep Tamagotchi full and happy, it will grow into
a cute, happy cyber creature. If you neglect Tamagotchi, it will grow into
an unattractive alien.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>DISCIPLINE STATUS CHECK</B></CENTER>


<P>As the meter moves towards the right, it indicates you are raising a
well-behaved Tamagotchi.

<P>The higher the discipline scale the less trouble and better behaved
Tamagotchi will be. The key to increasing the discipline meter is to make
sure you scold Tamagotchi when necessary. If Tamagotchi beeps at you for
no reason, you must discipline it.

<P>Tamagotchi needs discipline if it:

<P>- beeps at you even though it is full and happy

<P>- won't eat when it is hungry

<P>- won't play games when it is not very happy
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>AGE AND WEIGHT CHECK</B></CENTER>


<P>Converts and displays Tamagotchi's growth information in earth units.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>BIOLOGY</B></CENTER>


<P>- One earth day is equal to about one year for Tamagotchi.

<P>- Tamagotchi will change appearance several times before it reaches
its adult form.

<P>- It seems that the shape, personality and life of each Tamagotchi is
based on how well you take care of it. Each time you hatch a new Tamagotchi
it could grow up to be any one of several adult forms. Tomagotchi will
always return to its home planet. How well you care for it helps determine
how long Tamagotchi will stay on Earth. When it is time for Tamagotchi
to return to its home planet, there is nothing you can do. But, don't worry,
you can always hatch another egg.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>WILL YOU BE A GOOD CARETAKER FOR TAMAGOTCHI?</B></CENTER>


<P>0-5 YEARS: Try harder next time

<P>6-10 YEARS: Room for improvement

<P>11-16 YEARS: Good job

<P>17-22 YEARS: Excellent

<P>23+ YEARS: Amazing!
<P>In order to hatch another Tamagotchi, press the A and C buttons simultaneously
and a new pulsating egg will appear. In about 5 minutes a new Tamagotchi
will be born. Maybe you will raise a different version of Tamagotchi this
time. Try it and see.
<CENTER></CENTER>
